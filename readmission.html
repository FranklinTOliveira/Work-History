<h1>The Case for the Secession that Was...</h1>

<p>The story of the American Civil War is the story of the secession that was and wasn't. At first, the evidence suggested that the secession was the secession that was. After all, for a law to remain in place in anything but name, it must be effectively enforced. The United States Federal Government held that its laws put the Southern States within the Union, rendering secession null and void. Nevertheless, the Southern States backed their Ordinances of Secession by ending the effective authority of the Union over their states. The evidence then suggested that their secession was the secession that was.</p>
		
<h1>...As Well As the Evidence to the Contrary at This Site!</h1>

<p>If the United States Federal Government held to the contrary, it could still crush the Confederate rebellion. What it did after suppressing the rebellion would be determined by its explanation of what actually happened. At this site, this historian will explain how the secession that was became the secession that wasn't.</p>
