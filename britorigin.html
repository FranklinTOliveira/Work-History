      <h1 id="britorigin">The Origin of the British People</h1>
      <p>The origin of the British people are 1) Stone Age hunter-gatherers, 2) Iberian farmers, 3) Bell-Beaker Steppe people, 4) an Iron Age element, 5) the Anglo-Saxons and 6) the Normans.</p>
      <h2>STONE-AGE HUNTER-GATHERERS</h2>
      <p>The Ice Age covered Britain with ice so that the first Britons were anatomically modern humans rather than Neanderthals.
      They arrived at about the time agriculture was emerging elsewhere due to the retreat of Ice Age glaciers.</p>
      <section><h2>IBERIAN FARMERS</h2>
      <aside id="specials"><h3>Anatolian Farmers</h3>
      <p>In Anatolia, domesticated breeds of plants and animals were bred by a collectivist, egalitarian monument-building culture. Although Stone Age peoples were often violent, with more people equaling more violence, in Neolithic Anatolia, the peace was kept, as pilgrimages to holy sites drew in people to enjoy festivals and build monuments. The sense of community in these pilgrim congregations bound them increasingly into real communities, as the pilgrims built cities to stay by the holy sites and as they farmed in order to stay in the cities.</p>
      <p>To reinforce collectivism, there was egalitarianism—each household in the city had a house of equal size and over each generation, each household stayed in the same house, until after the passage of generations, the once-inhabited story in that house was made into a mausoleum for the ancestors and another story was built to accommodate the living generations of the household. Since these household dwellings had no alleyways and streets, the effect of this was that to enter these cities, one had to climb several stories and then descend down from the city’s communal rooftop!</p></aside>
      <aside id="specials"><h3>Neolithic Demographic Transition</h3>
      <p>Whenever and wherever the Stone Age transitioned from the Paleolithic to the Neolithic, from foraging to agriculture, there was the Neolithic Demographic Transition (an abrupt increase in birth rates due to the increased food supply and decreased mobility of farmers compared to foragers followed by the population stabilizing again, possibly because settling down in one place, in close proximity to animals, encouraged the spread of diseases spread by animals and water). These transitions took place over at least one thousand years, though usually a bit or a lot longer. In Anatolia, it took about three millennia.</p>
      <p>The disease outbreak that ended the transition destroyed the egalitarian cities through more than just deaths. The mass deaths caused controversies over what to do next. The controversies destroyed the consensus-building that governed the communities. Conflict over how to govern the communities instead generated civil wars. Civil wars created mass exoduses from the cities.</p>
      <p>The factions that left were family-based and hierarchical—the men accepted the fatherly guidance of a headman. Their households were thus knit into clans. These clans dispossessed and struggling to carve out a new home for themselves became nomadic warriors until such time that they could settle down. Pottery was invented to enhance the storehouses of these wealthy and powerful men wherever they settled down.</p>
      <p>With regard to the ancestors of the people of Britain, these nomadic warrior clans had settled down further to the west of Anatolia for about a millennium, as a minor wave of the Neolithic Demographic Transition took place. When however the Transition’s major wave took place, long-settled farming communities followed the path of their nomadic warrior predecessors and fanned out for new lands. This time they spread throughout the Mediterranean providing most of the ancestry for that region’s people ever since. This is where the descent of Britons from Iberian farmers comes in because the Iberian Peninsula was the hub from which migrating farmers seeding new communities pivoted from westward migration to northward migration, populating the Atlantic coast up to Britain and Ireland and replacing the previous population by a factor of 90% six millennia before the current year. It was these ancient Britons from Iberia and before that from Anatolia who would bring the monument-building culture with them, resulting in megaliths like Stonehenge.</p></aside></section>
      <section><h2>Steppe People</h2>
      <p>The nomadic warrior clans that left the cities at the end of the Neolithic Demographic Transition tried to settle down to return to farming…at least, the ones who migrated west along the Mediterranean and north along the Atlantic. Other such clans, the ones migrating across the Black Sea to the Pontic-Caspian Steppes, whose language is known to linguists as Proto-Indo-European, adapted to a nomadic warrior lifestyle more permanently. With the Steppe far less than ideal for growing crops but very ideal for livestock grazing, these Bell-Beaker Steppe People had an abundance of cattle relative to the number of people among them. With cattle, came a genetic evolution to overcome lactose intolerance. They also domesticated the horse. This was a long process—the horse for many centuries was too small and weak to support a rider so instead teams of them were used to pull carts and chariots. This steppe people’s culture developed over two thousand years from six thousand years ago to four thousand years ago. Meanwhile a Second Neolithic Demographic Transition occurred in continental Europe, throughout which the farming folk had spread from Anatolia.</p>
      <aside id="specials"><h3>Second Neolithic Demographic Transition</h3>
      <p>The wave of farming communities peopling Europe from out of Anatolia, the Early European Farmers, underwent a Second Demographic Transition. With new lands to colonize, they grew as crop yields were enhanced. With survivors adapting to disease, disease stopped as a barrier to population growth. Yet as the Early European Farmers grew, as their Anatolian ancestors once did, the old problems returned. Disease mutated to more lethal forms, as increased human population provided incubators for disease microbes to develop due to resulting livestock population growth and contamination of water.</p>
      <p>Even before the Second Millennium BCE, the Steppe Peoples had exploited societal collapse among the Early European Farmers to colonize new lands up the Danube. Then in Central Europe they developed into the Corded Ware Culture. The men of the Corded Ware Culture found kindred spirits in a warrior culture that was developing at the same time in the Iberian Peninsula, the Bell-Beaker Culture. Accordingly they too increasingly adopted Bell-Beaker Culture.</p>
      <p>While further research is needed before definite conclusions can be made about this prehistory, the information provided by this analysis so far explains the Celtic world as the Romans found it. The mainland of Europe was Celtic, at least to the west. The Iberian Peninsula had a mixture of tribes, some Celtic and some with a culture unique to the Iberian Peninsula. The resulting mixture of tribes influenced one another so that the people of the peninsula could be called Celtiberian. Indeed the Celtic tribes in this mix could well have absorbed Celtic culture through harmonious interaction rather than arrive and conquer. In turn the contrast between the Celts proper and the Celtiberians could well have been echoed by the difference on Britain and Ireland between P-Celts, so called because of a linguistic quirk and the Q-Celts, so called because of a differing linguistic quirk, even as this difference was itself an echo between original Bell-Beakers and Bell-Beakers through assimilation. The P-Celts were peoples that saw themselves as Painted Folk due to common facial painting, thus names like Briton and Pict derived from words for paint. The Q-Celts called themselves Gaels similar to how other Celts called themselves Gauls or Galatians.</p></aside></section>
      <section><h2>AN IRON-AGE ELEMENT</h2>
      <p>The similar self-identification of Q-Celts with Celts on mainland Europe and a lack of written material on the Celtiberians suggests that the people who replaced the Early European Farmers of Britain and Ireland were not Q-Celts descended from the Steppe Peoples mentioned but by the culturally similar Celtiberians whose arrival in Britain and Ireland populating those islands with P-Celts. Such was the population shift four thousand years ago. At that time, there was another mass replacement by a 90% factor but because there were abundant conquered women to seize as enslaved concubines, this mass replacement was biased towards a replacement in the male lineage rather than the female lineage.</p>
      <p>Later however a new significant population shift occurred during the Iron Age. That shift could be due to Q-Celts or due to the Romans. The working hypothesis of historians was that Roman colonization did not provide a significant population shift, that the Roman colonists were just an administrative elite minority. Evidence so far seems to support this hypothesis.</p>
      <p>The Q-Celts appear on the earliest written records as Gaels and were based then out of Ireland. When they formed pirate expeditions to raid the island of Britain, they were called Scotti. Accordingly the Romans would sometimes call Ireland “Scottorum” (Land of the Scots) but when their hold on the island of Britain collapsed, the most successful Scotti pirate tribe, the Dal Riata, created a kingdom that would colonize the northern section of the island of Britain, that kingdom came to be called Scotland instead. Their island of origin would on the contrary be referred to as Eire or Ireland. Even when an old Latin name was used, the name “Hibernia” was preferred for Ireland over “Scottorum”.</p>
      <p>So the Gaels inhabited Ireland, the Britons and Picts inhabited Britain and then eventually the Gaels colonized a section of the island of Britain. Further investigation shows the picture to be more complex and nuanced—some of the Celtic tribe names found in the historical record suggest that there were some Gaelic tribes on the island of Britain amongst a larger number of Briton and Pict tribes. After all, the continental homeland of the Q-Celts was even closer to the island of Britain than to the island of Ireland. On the other hand, most tribes on the island of Britain south of Hadrian’s Wall were assimilated by the Roman colonial administration into the Roman citizen body, whether they were Gaels or Britons. The Roman conquerors demilitarized these assimilated natives. Therefore when the army of the Romans themselves became sufficiently weak, the Romanized Celts of the Province of Britannia were particularly vulnerable to the next wave of invaders.</p></section>
      <section id="people"><h2>ANGLO-SAXONS</h2>
      <p>The factionalism of the declining Roman Empire meant that increasingly the legions in Britain recognized a different man as Emperor from the legions in continental Europe. Increasingly the legions in continental Europe were unable to retaliate as the Empire weakened further. Furthermore the enduring memory of Magnus Maximus, revered as Emperor by Roman soldiers in Britain but scorned elsewhere was an ideological basis for the recruitment of soldiers from Roman Britannia to the peninsula of Armorica where Conan Meriadoc, a soldier of Magnus Maximus, established himself as a warlord. Thus Armorica would be renamed Brittany, with the –y suffix indicating a little version of Britain, as opposed to the island that accordingly became known as Great Britain.</p>
      <p>Still the warlords that came after Magnus Maximus were even less successful as the dukes, generals over the legions, in Roman Britain increasingly sought their power rather than support the power of anyone claiming to be Emperor. These dukes originally commanded Roman legions and governed out of Roman cities but cultural shifts in the period of imperial decline led to a revival of Celtic tribal culture.</p>
      <p>Disruptions in trade and travel made cities increasingly unviable and what remained increasingly were no more than large villages. The population shifted to aristocratic villas where patronage ties revived the clan as a form of social organization. More than that, the warlords, whether they named themselves dukes or openly presided as tribal kings brought about a demographic shift. The clash of legion against legion, the lack of reinforcement by new legions from the Continent and the exodus of soldiers to Brittany meant that the dukes and kings of the collapsing Roman Province of Britannia needed new soldiers to fight off invasions that increasingly endangered their realms.</p>
      <p>Tribes of Angles, Saxons and Jutes—people who would be named Anglo-Saxons when they united into the Kingdom of England but who arrived on the island as tribes with distinct tribal identities—first arrived as sets of people who were assimilated by the Empire as soldiers and settlers as early as the Third Century CE. The subsequent chain migrations fed the Roman province with new citizens who assimilated smoothly enough until there wasn’t much of a Province, let alone an Empire, to assimilate the newcomers. Instead the dukes and kings who were there instead imported whole clans of these people and rather than assimilate them as beforehand kept them as cohesive, intact fighting units to fight off invasion from the Picts coming from the north. The Roman soldiers previously guarding the border, themselves recruited from local allied tribes rather than fully assimilated Romans, were enticed south to Wales, also as intact clans deployed as cohesive fighting units to defend Wales from Scotti piracy based out of Ireland.</p>
      <p>The issue with these fifth to sixth century mercenary clans was pay. As more battles were needed to secure impoverished lands, the mercenary clans always wanted to be better paid. Eventually they paid themselves by seizing the lands of their employers. The Picts did not take Britannia; instead, the Angles, Saxons and Jutes paid to defend Britannia took most of it. The Scotti established a few petty kingdoms in Wales but again it was mostly the mercenary clans recruited to save the independence of the locals from the Scotti who instead built most of the petty kingdoms of medieval Wales by subjugating the locals instead.</p>
      <p>The then-new element for these islands was thus the Anglo-Saxons. Perhaps they had replaced the Romanized Celts, as they had replaced the Early European Farmers who had replaced the original foragers. The dramatic change in language and place-names suggests as much. Yet closer analysis suggests that the replacement of Romanized Celts by Anglo-Saxons was driven by elite-led assimilation rather than mass replacement.</p>
      <p>Firstly the genetics suggests continuity. Mass graves and mass movements of people do not show up at the right time in the archaeological record. On the other hand, linguistic analysis of Old English shows something intriguing. The words themselves are Germanic, as suggested by the history of Anglo-Saxon migration. The way however that they are organized is not typically Germanic. It is as if foreign-language learners quickly adapted to a new language but lacked the expertise in the subject matter to their use their new lingustic knowledge properly. To explain further, an exploration of how sectarian identity both reinforced and was reinforced by ethnic and regional identity in the declining Roman Empire is in order.</p>
      <aside id="specials"><h3>Sectarian and Other Roman Identities</h3>
      <p>The conversion of Romans from diverse pagan identities to affiliation with the Church did not give them a united identity. Instead sectarian disputes over which set of beliefs was held by the true Church spread through ethnic and regional societal networks to create the fusion of sectarian identity with ethnic and regional identity in the declining Roman Empire and later in the ruins of that Empire. The Christianity favored by the Church in Alexandria spread through Egypt; the Egyptian Christians then saw themselves as the true Church persecuted by heretical outsiders. The Christianity favored the Church in Antioch spread through Syria; the Syrians then saw themselves as the true Church persecuted by heretical outsiders. The election of the Catholicos, the leading clergyman of the Armenian Church, was secured by the King; thus the independence of the Armenian Kingdom and Church were inseparable. The Germanic tribes invading the Roman Empire were won over by missionaries teaching the Christianity advocated by the Egyptian theologian Arius. When the Emperors after Constantine decisively favored the Nicene Creed over the Christianity of Arius (Arianism), the conquering Germans often imposed Arianism on conquered lands, presenting this as the defense of the true Church and therefore evidence that they deserved to rule.</p>
      <p>It should be mentioned that the German tribes converted to Arianism entered the Empire through Eastern Europe. In general, with more cities in the East, the Church, as an organization that then was urban-based, was developed in that portion of the Empire. Christianity existed in the Western Roman Empire and even spread from there to Ireland. Yet it was weaker there, conquering paganism later. Accordingly the German tribes of northern Europe, from the Franks at the Empire’s Rhine River borders and beyond were also late converts to Christianity. The Franks were drawn into the Catholic Church ironically about when the Roman Empire collapsed in the West. The Angles, Saxons and Jutes remained pagan however and when they arrived in Britain they stayed pagan.</p>
      <p>Quite simply they rejected the institutional organization beyond the tribe represented by the Church. They preferred the simple, straightforward organization by tribal priesthoods and tribal kings. This vision of collapsing the Empire in Britain to the tribe and consolidating the collapse through religion led to the enticement of the conquered population away from Christianity and into Anglo-Saxon tribal congregations. The revival of Christianity would come later, as Anglo-Saxon kingdoms devouring other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms sought military alliances with the Christian powers beyond their neighbors to secure their power. By then, a change of identity from the Roman and the Celt to the Anglo-Saxon remained even as the people returned to the Church.</p>

      <section id="people"><h2>NORMANS</h2>
      <p>The Normans were not the last set of people to immigrate to the island of Britain but they were the last element to the origins of that island’s people. They were tens of thousands of immigrants amongst a population of over a million. Their significance to the population’s origins lies not in the origin of the masses. It is true that the Norman lords brought over Norman servants as well as Breton (from Brittany) and Flemish auxiliaries. Yet the main significance of the Normans demographically was that they replaced the old elite with a new elite. Thus the previous elements of original foragers, Early European Farmers, Painted People, Gaels, Romans and Anglo-Saxons became ancestors for the masses while the aristocracy descended from later Norman arrivals.</p></section>
