<h3>What if the purpose of Congress and Parliament is to avoid accountability?</h3>
<p>The desire of citizens for strong Congressional and Parliamentary authority is rooted in the belief that these institutions make government accountable. What if their purpose is to make government unaccountable?</p>
<p>The beginning of the elected legislature was in the 11th and 12th centuries. Although kings had always been obliged to rule in cooperation with advisory councils, the delicate balance of power between rising monarchies and the independent in all but name forces of lords and towns meant that to seize the power they craved, kings would now have to co-opt the lords and towns into the advisory councils.</p>
<p>This required a concession, one step back in the seizure of power before taking two steps forward through the accumulation of more money. Beforehand kings were, if competent and strong enough, able to undermine the advisory councils as checks on royal powers by stuffing them with ministers who owed their positions to the king. This could go on no longer. Instead the structures and sessions of the advisory councils would be formalized creating the institution of Parliament. High lords would possess membership of Parliament as a matter of course. Petty lords and towns would elect representatives in elections for MPs (Members of Parliament).</p>
<p>The usefulness of Parliament allowed kings to expand royal rights at the expense of people through the raising of more funds. This however had two hard limits.</p>
<p>Firstly, to co-opt aristocrats and towns into cooperation with the King’s Parliament, kings had to accept that its advice became mandatory regarding the raising of new taxes. Secondly, once royal power became too entrenched for the aristocrats and towns to challenge independently, the leverage provided by Parliament allowed them a forum to resist the King on behalf of the propertied interests of the realm.</p>
<p>Here attention should be paid to Western Europe, as there the template for Congresses and Parliaments the world over was first established. Already by the 13th-15th centuries, Parliaments had shown that they could restrict the growth of royal rights at the expense of the people just as much as they could enable the King to enhance his rights at the expense of the people. Still the increasing strength of parliamentarianism did not evolve into constitutional monarchism until many centuries later for two reasons.</p>
<p>Firstly, a Revolution in Military Affairs meant that a big fighting force (with a powerful commander-in-chief such a king) could crush and size thee property held by smaller fighting forces (serving lesser powers such as aristocrats and towns). Secondly the revenue flows extracted from overseas colonies was tapped into by kings through various means. This led to the growth of absolutism where monarchs became absolute monarchs by sidelining Parliament. Yet England and the Netherlands would be exceptions to the rise of absolutism in Europe, exceptions that inspired philosophers to explain and urge to the people the need for a revival of parliamentarianism.</p>
<p>At the same time, that demand for parliamentarianism arose, the opportunity to revive it was also emerging. As secure royal power led generation after generation of kings to pursue self-indulgence rather than the complex, tedious work of administering their states, there arose bureaucratic red tape and expanding budget deficits that prevented the king’s courtiers for fixing the problems of state for them. These bureaucrats, as well as the financiers that allowed for kings to run up high debts, advised King Louis XVI, a King of France who faced the sum total of these problems to the highest degree, to revive France’s parliamentary General Estates. The General Estates was taken over by the Third Estate who insisted that members of the other two estates had renounce their membership as representatives of separate Estates to participate in the Constituent Assembly, a reorganization of the Third Estate that tasked itself with writing a Constitution. With the Kingdom of France possessing a Constitution, elections were held for a National Assembly from which the Jacobin Party would push for the replacement of the monarchy with the creation of the First French Republic. The muscle used by both parliamentarians and outright republicans was the citizen revolutionary.</p>
<p>The citizen revolutionary was at war with his government. He fought for Parliament because Parliament defended the rights of the people against the King. If however this was so, then shouldn’t Parliament be elected by universal suffrage rather than by the propertied? For that matter, the King was the ultimate example of a propertied individual. Accordingly, the mood amongst citizen revolutionaries tended to radicalize in favor of abolishing monarchies and replacing them by republics led by parliaments elected by universal suffrage.</p>
<p>This radicalization of parliamentarianism into republicanism in turn changed the way in which Parliament was significant to begin with. Parliament traditionally stood for the interests of property but in a situation of revolutionary warfare, the propertied were often targets because of their tendencies towards royalism, even among many prosperous commoners.</p>
<p>Eventually the failures of the French Revolution meant that that parliamentary factions become more constitutionalist and more gradualist. Constitutionalism however only delayed the paradoxes of using Parliament to defend the rights of the people.</p>
<p>The first problem was party politics. In monarchy, aristocrats and urban MPs represented local interests and often were e together for this against centralization by their kings. This allowed for independent politicians. With a struggle against royalism and later over what replaced royalism, an instinctive tendency for politics to group people into parties was irreversible.</p>
<p>The second problem was lobbyists. The original stance of parliamentarians was defense or rights against royal overreach. Yet what was or was not a right depended on what was right and just. Sentiments of egalitarianism forbid designating the privileged with the authority to judge such things themselves so the solution devised was a regulatory bureaucracy that regulated, be there overreach or no overreach. This enabled regulatory capture, where the regulated became more privileged due to regulation rather than less because the politicians and senior bureaucrats were effectively lobbied by the regulated. The result was that rather than be abolished, privilege changed from an official form tied to property into an unofficial form tied to regulatory capture funded by the revenues obtained by property.</p>
<p>The third problem was that party politics and lobbying meant that rather than serve the people without fear or favor, Parliament was weaponized by the savvy to wage war on their targets of choice. The economic rivalries were eternal—they who benefited from extensive infrastructure lost when infrastructure was in disrepair and vice versa, they who benefited from free trade lost when protectionism was prominent and vice versa, and they who benefited from localized regulatory authority lost when centralized regulatory authority was prominent and vice versa.</p>
<p>This fueled a political divide that merged the politics of economics with the politics of social issues organized around identitarianism (the politics of identity). Should culture be a traditionalist, rural Christian culture or a futurist, urban multicultural salad bowl? There were paradoxes within paradoxes. A fundamentalist sect that was non-Christian or non-white may be ideologically closer to the first option but politically aligned with the second option because the organizational principle of the second option was less secularism or tolerance (even if these were self-proclaimed principles) than organization against success by believers in the first option.</p>
<p>These concerns of party politics, lobbyism and citizen rights that are emphasized or denied depending on who is politically victorious all mean that Congress, Parliament or the Constitution will serve the People without fear or favor. Instead these concepts that defended the rights of the People in an earlier era are now weaponized by the savvy to deny the rights of their targets.</p>
