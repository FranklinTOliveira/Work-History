      <h1 id="lifeproject">Armenia’s Continued Survival is a Russian Project</h1>
      <p id="nicepresentation">The history of Armenia for the last few centuries shows why Armenia’s continued survival is a Russian project. Already in the late medieval period, the Armenians were a weak, vulnerable minority in their ancestral homeland, as Armenians were moved out and replaced by Kurds and Turks. Then in the 18th and 19th centuries, the Russian Empire moved into the Caucasus. The Russian Army seized ancestral Armenian lands held by the Ottoman and Persian Empires and retaliated against the resistance of these empires through reprisals against Muslim civilians. Thus Kurds and Turks were forced to vacate their land. The newly dominant Russian Empire then resettled these newly vacated lands with Christian settlers. That’s how Azerbaijan, for example, gained villages of Molokans, a pacifist Russian sect that practiced a minority form of religious communism before, during and after the Bolsheviks imposed a more common secular communism onto the masses. However most of the Christian settlers received land in the South Caucasus were Armenians from communities abroad whose ancestral founders had been expelled by earlier Muslim invaders. Thus the Armenian capital of Yerevan went from a city with double-digit percentage of Muslims to an overwhelmingly majority Armenian city once more.</p>
      <p id="nicepresentation">World War One and its aftermath proved once against the dependence of Armenia on Russia. While the mass deaths of Armenians sent to Damascus and Deir ez-Zor is infamous, a lot of the Armenians who instead survived the Genocide linked up with the partisans waging an insurgency against the Ottoman Empire to prepare the land for a Russian invasion into eastern Anatolia. This invasion did go into land formerly held by the Ottoman enemy, at least until the 1917 Revolutions disorganized the Russian Army, allowing the Ottoman Army to strike back.</p>
      <p id="nicepresentation">Even then, the Genocide survivors saved by the Russian Army and its partisan allies were able to fall back into land still secured by Armenians. There the fledging Armenian Republic stood its ground, saving Armenian lives until it could no longer fight and then it was saved from annihilation by the fact that the USSR took over, established an Armenian Republic within itself and then forced its boundaries of choice between the Armenians and their Turkic neighbors.</p>
      <p id="nicepresentation">In the USA, we know of the Armenians who immigrated from Lebanon and Syria. However the Armenians that wanted to live as Armenians in Armenia could look to the USSR. Accordingly these Armenians used the Right of Return granted by the Soviets to migrate from Lebanon and Syria to Armenia in the ‘50s and ‘60s.</p>
      <p id="nicepresentation">The next important point in this timeline was in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s when Armenia, Artsakh and Azerbaijan all gained their independence from the USSR. While the instinct of the USSR was to enforce the subordination of Artsakh to Azerbaijan, the same Soviet soldiers shifted their stance towards the matter when in 1992, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Russia picked apart the army left by the fallen USSR. While Russia aligned itself with both Armenia and Azerbaijan, it was also crucial in ensuring that Armenia survived. Quite simply, with a Russian garrison in Armenia, Turkey did not dare to invade Armenia to reinforce the Armed Forces of Azerbaijan.</p>
      <p id="nicepresentation">Since then, Armenia has tried to be an ally of both the USA and Russia. However while Russia continues to prevent Turkey from committing an Armenian Genocide of the 21st century to match the Armenian Genocide of the 20th century, there are hard limits to what the USA can do for Armenia. To put troops to Armenia’s north would be to make a commitment to Georgia that it does not want to make because of its conflict with Russia. To put troops to Armenia’s west, east and south would mean pushing inland through hostile territory in Azerbaijan, Iran and Turkey to establish the peacekeeper garrisons. And perhaps most importantly, after military disasters in Afghanistan and Iraq, the USA’s interest is in less projection of power worldwide, not more. Therefore if Armenia wishes to support Artsakh or even survive, it must exploit Russia’s desire to exploit Caucasus as a barrier of hostile forces attempting a break-in into Russian territory—neither Biden nor Trump will rescue Armenia or Artsakh but perhaps an Armenian lobbyist who knows the right way to appeal to Putin will.</p>
