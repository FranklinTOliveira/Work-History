        <h2>Consolidation of the Christian Church under the Supervision of Rome</h2>
        <p>When Saint Constantine the Great made Christianity the official religion of the Roman Empire, he made possible the establishment of Ecumenical Councils, synods of all bishops in the Catholic Church. Under him and the Emperors succeeding him, the Ecumenical Councils composed creeds affirming and defining Orthodoxy, determined which holy books were the Word of God (and thus worthy of inclusion in the Bible, the Church’s collection of the revelations canonically considered to form the Word of God) and established how the Hierarchy (Sacred Leadership) would be organized. In the process, dissidents were excommunicated (expelled from the Church) as heretics.</p>
        <p>Bishops of cities were now under the constant supervision of archbishops/metropolitans. While before, such leaders mainly chaired the synods where legitimate bishops were ordained into their offices by colleagues, now such leaders sought authority to appoint the constituent bishops to enforce Orthodoxy. Ecumenical councils clarified that the region of an Archbishop/Metropolitan was his province within the Roman Empire and that the capital city of that province would be his personal bishopric. Prior to Constantine, bishops were elected by their congregations. After him, they were selected by the powers-that-be: the aristocrats, the Crown and the prominent clergy. Monarchs, in particular, sought the centralization of the episcopal hierarchy to thereby control the Church. The bishops’ administrative staff, the presbyters (elders) evolved into:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Priests: As the Eucharist was deemed the sacrificial offering by which the Body and Blood of Christ was offered, Christian presbyters were deemed priests by analogy with the temple butchers of the Jews and pagans.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Deans: The presbyters that assisted the bishop in administering the clergy were called deans.</li>
          </ul>
        <p>In keeping with assigning control of a Roman province’s branch of the Catholic Church to an archbishop/metropolitan, the ecumenical councils later assigned ecclesiastical exarchs to administer the branch of the Church in each portion of the Roman Empire governed by an exarch (Imperial viceroy). Naturally the highest clergymen, the Patriarchs, were of necessity Church Exarchs but such rank was not in and of itself sufficient to be a Patriarch. Further meetings of Ecumenical Councils had a controversy on the qualifications to become a Patriarch: the Roman Emperor (now based in Constantinople) sought such status for the Bishops of the five key cities of Christendom: Rome, Constantinople, Antioch, Alexandria & Jerusalem in opposition to the Petrine doctrine that held that the legitimate Patriarchs of the Church as holders of the highest Church rank should trace the authority of their office from Peter, the chief of the apostles. The bishoprics of three cities—Rome, Antioch & Alexandria—were the bishoprics held by tradition to trace their authority from Peter.</p>
        <h2>Christology</h2>
        <p>The Gnostic position was that Christ was a God and that his Humanity was an illusion. The Arian position was that Christ was a man not quite God but his right-hand man. The Nestorian position was that Christ was a man in but not merged with God having the nature of both. The Monophysite position was that Christ had one nature. The modified position was that Christ had one major emerging of human and divine t-shirts. The Chalcedon Declaration said that Christ had two Natures human and divine as one person within the trinity.</p>
        <h2>Splits after the Council of Chalcedon</h2>
        <p>The Church of the East based in the land of the Assyrians seized upon Nestorian Christology to align itself with the Persians dominating Assyria rather than the Romans dominated most of the church’s people. The Egyptian Church upheld the Miaphysite Christology that was caricatured by the supporters of the Chalcedon declaration as Monophysitism. To counter such heresy the Roman Empire sought to replace the incumbent Church of Egypt with an Orthodox Church of Egypt at the same time the Roman authorities sought to promote their Chalcedon Orthodoxy from being replaced by the Monophysite heresy in the broader church. About half to a century later. Imprisoned Monophysite clergy and Constantinople and commissions Jacobus Baradaeus to reestablish the Monophysite Church in the Levant he wasn't ascetic monk who then spent the rest of his life as an itinerant preacher building a Levantine Monophysite church of Antioch in accordance with the Petrine doctrine that the bishop of Jerusalem was not counted as a patriarch.</p>
        <h2>Catholicoi & Patriarchs</h2>
        <p>In the Roman Empire, financial administrators of large organizations are known in the singular as catholicos and in the plural as Catholicoi. The Church used such administrators to govern monastic orders and missions to the people beyond the borders of the Roman Empire. Roman emperors wanted a centralized hierarchy of Clergy where the patriarch supervise The Bishop's with the Bishops alternating between the supervision of their diocese and assisting the patriarch and his supervising the Bishops—those Bishops assisting the patriarch of the Holy Synod all through which the Emperor selected the next patriarch. Similar organizations were formed as part of the anti-Roman politics of the Armenian and Assyrian churches with the catholicoi above their churches raised in rank from Bishop to patriarch in the eastern half of the Roman Empire and still further east centralized hierarchy became the form through which the church managed its bishops. In the western half of the Roman Empire the collapse of Civil order dispersed Imperial oversight of Bishops to lesser Kings and local overlords increasingly Bishops were autonomous of the patriarch of Rome and more controlled by local Lords and local clergy together with the chief vassals of the local Lords.</p>
        <h2>Emergence of the Papacy as an Institution</h2>
        <p>With the Christians of the Roman Empire being fought over by the Patriarchs of Rome, Constantinople and Alexandria, the Patriarchs of Constantinople had a vital advantage by virtue of proximity to the Emperor. The partisans of the Sees of Alexandria and Rome countered with a cult of personality centered on the office holders of their favored Sees. The most enduring piece of propaganda from such cults of Personality was the term Pope for these officeholders which was derived from pappas, the casual Greek word for “father”. Around the Roman Pope, there came the bishops fleeing persecution by Arian German Kingdoms in the west and Pagan Slavic tribes in the East that is in the Balkans due to the broad jurisdiction of his See. Not all such bishops could be honored with new dioceses. Therefore they received the honorary title of Cardinal. Cardinal meant key individual and they were key to the Pope's staff. In particular, Greek speaking bishops and monks from the Balkans formed the dominant force in the Roman papacy being behind even the adoption of the papal title. As the emperors in Constantinople lost their hold over Italy, the Franks entered the peninsula aligned their kingdom with the Papacy and building a new Holy Roman Empire. Alas, this Empire collapsed and its bishoprics including the Papacy became appendages of local aristocratic houses.</p>
        <h2>Monastic Orders</h2>
        <p>When a Christian renounced the world, he would pursue poverty, chastity and obedience; he did this in order to get salvation in Christ—in other words, he became a monk. Ironically the word for monk came from the word for solitary. This is because the first monks were hermits. Still the Christian Life, the pious life, attracted so many recruits that they formed community these communities were strictly ran communes called monasteries. The monasteries in turn consolidated themselves into networks called orders that regulated the lives of the monks. As the bishoprics of the West and through them the monasteries became subject to aristocratic corruption and as the piety of the West diminished in a societal collapse promoting factionalism and selfishness there arose a sense of disillusionment with the existing society. The disillusionment was expressed in a monastic Revival. Disillusioned lords set up monasteries directly subject to the papacy rather than to the local bishopric and donated manors to these monasteries to make them independent of the local aristocracy and to fund their good works as well. These monasteries were far more strict and imposing poverty, chastity and obedience as well as extending the reach of monastic regulations to all members regardless of aristocratic background. The original patrons often ended their lives as members as these new rigorous monasteries acquired more land members and power. Newer patrons instead strategically sent the younger brothers of their heirs to join the emerging, more prestigious monasteries. Monks of the Cluny Order were even favored by the monarch of a revived Holy Roman Empire who installed one of them into the papacy and presided over his installation of brother monks as Cardinals.</p>
        <h2>Bishops</h2>
        <p>After the Apostles of Jesus Christ died, the Church was a network of city-based congregations. Each had a Bishop as administrative overseer, Priests as spokesmen for the Bishop and Deacons as assistants tasked with the menial labor of the Church. These city-based congregations touted their affiliation with Christ’s universal assembly (the Catholic Church). Catholicism was expressed by:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Communion: The congregations acknowledging each other as members of the Body of Christ.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Synods: These were the councils of bishops presiding over the congregations of their region as the final word on the Church’s theology.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Synod Chairmen: The chairmen of the synods were selected from the cities from which missionary efforts were organized for the expansion of the Church. These chairmen were called Archbishops or Metropolitans when their influence was regional and Patriarchs when their influence was Church-wide.</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Orthodoxy/Heresy</h2>
        <p>Legitimate membership of the Catholic Church for congregations and individuals alike was determined by the standard of Orthodoxy, faith in accordance with the Word of God. Deviations were condemned as mere heresies (opinions). With pagan authorities hindering open meetings of the Catholic Church, the Orthodoxy of its congregations was in doubt as the factional allegiances of each congregation was orthodox to some and heretical to others.</p>
        <h2>Protestant Church Structure</h2>
        <p>The ecclesiastic structure of the Western church was strongly affected by the Protestant Reformation. “Protestant” itself referred to those protesting against papal authority. Three approaches to ecclesiastic authority emerged:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Episcopalian: Dioceses remained under the authority of bishops. Kings favored this approach because it allowed them to control their kingdom’s church easily through the appointment of bishops.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Presbyterian: The Church was controlled at its various geographical levels by boards of presbyters (elders) elected by their congregations, based on the priesthood of all believers.</li>
            <br/>
            <li>Independent: Clergy were elected by their congregations but did not submit to denominational boards of elders; instead, each congregation submitted to Jesus Christ directly in the manner they believed themselves to be ordered by the Word of God itself. While independent churches would later shun politics as “worldly” or advocate a politics separating church and state, initially their politics was different. Although these earlier churches formally labeled themselves “Independent”, outside preachers held supervisory power through the favor of established authorities.</li>
          </ul>
        <h2>Islam</h2>
        <p>After the death of Muhammed, no more prophets emerged in Islam. Instead scholars guided his people based on his words. One group based their authority on guarding his tradition (Sunnah) through the emerging consensus of scholars—such Muslims were called Sunnis. Another group based on their authority on partisanship for the lineage of Muhammed’s son-in-law Ali—such Muslims were called Shi’i by themselves but were scorned by Sunni hardliners as Rafidha (“rejecters” of Muhammed’s tradition). While scholars became the Islamic religious authority after his death, his authority over his state went to the khalīfah (this Arabic-language concept is translated into English as caliph; this author will use both words as he sees fit) tasked with bringing the world under the khalifat (this Arabic-language concept is translated into English as caliphate; this author will use both words as he sees fit).</p>
        <p>The khalifat was led by a council of Muslim elders often holding ministerial positions within the state electing the next khalīfah and confirming him in office with an oath of allegiance (bay’ah) that became obligatory on all other Muslims. After the Muslim general Mu'awiyah seized control of the khalifat, he established a precedent when he extracted a commitment from the elders to elect his favored son as his successor after his death; his would be the first dynasty of the khalifat, the Umayyad.</p>
        <p>Based on the office of the Imam, a scholar guiding the congregation of a mosque, dissidents in the Dar al-Islam  (World of Islam) considered the caliphate a secondary office of the Imam of the whole Ummah (universal community of all Muslims). In fact, Shi’a Islam was based on the belief that God blessed the chief of Ali’s lineage with the knowledge to properly interpret the Sunnah.</p>
        <p>When the armies of the Caliph emerged from the deserts of Arabia to conquer the southern Mediterranean lands of the Roman Empire and the whole of the Persian Empire, the existing aristocracies and bureaucracies were left in place and tasked with serving the caliphate. Instead of replacing them, the caliphate laid a military aristocracy of Arab tribal levies on top of them. Far from being a landed aristocracy, this military aristocracy was isolated in garrison cities to be mobilized for the Caliph’s wars and was to be sustained by the taxation of conquered populations and the plundering of enemy populations.</p>
        <p>While the apex of this empire’s hierarchy were urban Arabs such as the Quraysh tribe of Muhammed and other townsfolk descended from Muhammed’s companions (the Sahaba), the bulk of the Arab military aristocracy were the Bedouin known less for piety and pure faith than for offering service to the highest bidder as mercenaries. In accordance with such mercenary motives, the Bedouin of the Caliph’s garrison cities began to go AWOL when in the face of the caliphate’s imperial limits, plunder and imperial incentives to maintain big military payrolls declined. Instead the garrisoned Arab soldiers fanned out carving out rangelands from the properties of hapless subject peoples to resume the ways of their Bedouin ancestors. Indeed Arab soldiers who remained in garrisons needed to have their power, prestige and wealth catered to by imperial authorities for security reasons.</p>
