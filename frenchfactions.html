		<h2>Phases of France's Transition</h2>

		<ul>

		<li><p>1789-1794 (The World Turned Upside Down)</p></li>

		<p>An elected legislature turns France into a republic and imposes its egalitarian ideology onto the nation. Feudal dues are abolished. Aristocratic and Church lands are sold to speculators.</p>

		<li><p>1794-1799 (Instability)</p></li>

		<p>The French Republic is increasingly dependent on playing Left and Right against each other. This balancing does not prevent multiple coup d'etat.</p>

		<li><p>1799-1815 (Napoleon)</p></li>

		<p>Napoleon establishes a dictatorship that evolves into a constitutional monarchy.</p>

		<li><p>1815-1830 (Restoration)</p></li>

		<p>The restored House of Bourbon hedges on the question of constitutionalism.</p>

		<li><p>1830-1848 (July Monarchy)</p></li>

		<p>France becomes a constitutional monarchy under the House of Orleans following the July Revolution.</p>

		<li><p>1848-1851 (Second Republic)</p></li>

		<p>Disappointment with the constitutional monarchy of the House of Orleans leads to another revolution, establishing the Second French Republic.</p>

		<li><p>1852-1870 (Second Empire)</p></li>

		<p>The Republic is overthrown when its President, the third Napoleon, reestablishes the empire of his uncle, the first Napoleon.</p>

		<li><p>1870 (Third Republic Formed)</p></li>

		<p>In 1870, after the capture of Napoleon III by the Prussian Army, the legislature declares the monarchy defunct, establishing France's Third Republic.</p>

		</ul>

<article id="explanation">
		<p>From the French Revolution of 1789 to the Third French Republic established in 1870, French politics was a series of revolutions and counter-revolutionary restorations, featuring three main factions struggling for power. This page will serve the reader as a guide to these factions.</p>
		
		<p>France, at the time, was divided between the Left and the Right. The Right itself was divided between supporters of three rival dynasties while the Left advocated a democratic republic. The Left was militantly secular and at times persecuted people who adhered to the Catholic faith of the majority of the French. The Right sought to maintain government-enforced Catholicism though to what degree depended on what dynasty was given allegiance and which monarch led the dynasty at any given time.</p>
