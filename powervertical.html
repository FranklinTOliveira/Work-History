                <h1 id="vp">Vertical of Power</h1>
                <p>In the states of Eastern Europe, the prevailing institution is “the vertical of power”—this is the opposite of “the balance of power”. The vertical of power is characterized by having as few officeholders as possible at the topmost levels of power to make state policymaking more decisive. The balance of power is by contrast characterized by many officeholders at the topmost levels of power so that abuses by each powerholder are balanced out by many other individuals who likely enough are rivals.</p>
                <p>If the vertical of power sounds authoritarian, then you are correct. Such an arrangement is intended to limit rather than enhance democratic accountability. Democratic accountability was all the rage when the Soviet Bloc collapsed. Over time, however, an oligarchy emerged whose interests were in limiting rather than enhancing democratic accountability.</p>
                <p>For while democratization promised free enterprise rather than communism, it did not necessarily promote the emergence of capitalists, at least at first. Rather, small and medium enterprises were to be owned by their workers while large enterprises were to be owned by the State as key national assets.</p>
                <p>Aside from the egalitarian reality behind this rhetoric, the actual implementation in practice tended towards the production of an oligarchy. The shares of the workers in small and medium enterprises were managed by investment firms. The investment firms denied shareholders the protection of their interests that was their due and diverted assets to themselves. The large enterprises were later privatized in auctions stage-managed to give cronies legal title to assets for pennies on the dollar of the real value.</p>
                <p>The richest of rich oligarchs were upwardly mobile businessmen but the businessmen who were most successful in upward mobility fronted for mafiosi who themselves fronted for corrupt state officeholders. The corrupt state officeholders were politicians, lawyers and military officers but especially senior police officers. The legacy of communism was that the police forces were vast intelligence networks with operations at home and abroad. It was such networks that could bring home unaccounted revenue and then launder it into corrupt buyoffs of state assets without being investigated since they were the ones who were supposed to do the investigating. These networks of businessmen, mafiosi and state officeholders were called “oligarch clans”.</p>
                <p>The oligarch clans had enriched themselves fabulously through corrupt politics but the continuation of democracy offered the risk that the election of competitors could take back everything that they took. There was too much at stake for them to tolerate strong democracy. The return of Communism or even some other form of dictatorship was unthinkable as defense of the oligarch clans by a system that would have trouble defending itself was not appealing. Electoral democracy was to stay in place but by installing a key feature of many dictatorships—the vertical of power—the outcome of politics could provide the security of dictatorship without the unappealing face of dictatorship.</p>
                <h2>Baltic States & Warsaw Pact</h2>
                <p>In the Baltic States & Warsaw Pact, the vertical of power was based on reverence for the Western Bloc as a liberator and role model. If the political parties in these former Communist nations adhered to the policy promoted by academia, media and NGOs, of cooperation with the Western Bloc, then academia, media and the NGOs, all Western-based cultural institutions educating the population of Eastern Europe about the better lifestyles in the Western Bloc, would only rarely if ever promote purges of oligarchs. If anything, purging Western-aligned oligarchs would be condemned as “violating the rule of law”. Furthermore, investment flows between these Eastern European nations and the Western Bloc could cross borders uninhibitedly. The capstone of this was the integration of these nations into NATO and EU, making them an economic, military and political extension of the Western Bloc. At the same time, the obsession of the Western powers for establishing international institutions for the projection of power worldwide meant that the Western Bloc actively encouraged this pivot by the Eastern European oligarchs.</p>
                <h2>Russia</h2>
                <p>Very prominently in the ‘90s but often forgotten in the 21st Century, the Russian oligarchy too originally sought to establish a vertical of power outside of their own nation to protect their new gains. Russia also wanted to be integrated into NATO and the EU. Indeed aid for the Yeltsin Administration at key points in time encouraged the Russian oligarchy to integrate their nation into the West. The problem for the oligarchy was that Western interest in protecting Yeltsin from defeat by Communist opponents did not mean that the West sided with him against secessionists. Secessionist movements, especially in but by no means limited, to the Caucasus were excuses for the West to pressure Russia to relax the grip of its state. The Western powers also wanted Russia to be integrated into NATO and the EU but for them, entry was better done piece by piece since the integration of a united bloc with a vast resource and power base would unsettle their preferred balance of power within these emerging international institutions.</p>
                <p>Even after the end of the Yeltsin Administration, many leftover oligarchs wanted to maintain ties to the West. An opposing faction of the oligarchy however found that, with the West hostile to the Russian Federation, it could never provide a reliable, secure vertical of power for the Russian oligarchy. Towards the end of the Yeltsin Administration, they engineered a transfer of power from Yeltsin to Putin. Then they built up the Putin Administration into an imperial presidency.</p>
                <p>The imperial presidency of the Putin Administration cracked down on dissent. Firstly the faction of the oligarchy aligned with the West was purged. Dissent in general was severely limited by law but these legal restrictions on dissent were applied selectively. For if they were applied consistently, then opposing parties would be effectively outlawed and the dictatorship of the Putin Administration would occur openly. With selective enforcement, however, the opposing parties could make a name for themselves on subjects that the imperial presidency of the Putin Administration left open for discussion while at the same time, effective, strong critiques of the Putin Administration depended on discussing precisely the sort of subject matter that was not left open for discussion. The opposing parties then became a controlled opposition.</p>
                <h2>The Results of Putin’s Vertical of Power</h2>
                <p>A vertical of power based on the Putin Administration running an imperial presidency stabilized the nation’s economy after the turmoil of the ‘90s. During the Yeltsin Administration, the nervousness of the Russian oligarchy crippled Russia’s economy with capital flight. With Putin on their side, the oligarchs could now invest in Russia though because Putin could change his mind, the Russian oligarchs could never invest in their nation like the oligarchs of the Baltic States or former Warsaw Pact satellites. ON the contrary, even as they began to invest in their nation, they always made sure to divert a cut of the profits to their bank accounts in the West. An abundance of oil revenue gave the oligarchy more funds to invest but crucially even this was not enough for Russia to have the GDP Per Capita of the Baltic States or former Warsaw Pact satellites, let alone the Western powers themselves. Putin’s vertical of power did however create an environment in which the oligarchs could actually indulge in investment in 21st Century Russia, as opposed to the 1990s when turmoil in politics had an echo in a parallel turmoil in economics.</p>
                <h2>The Near Abroad</h2>
                <p>After the fall of the USSR, Russian politicians increasingly referred to the nations that shared membership of the USSR with Russia as “the Near Abroad”. In both Russia and the Near Abroad, secessionists wanted another wave of secessions. The fall of the USSR was achieved through secession by Soviet Socialist Republics. Secessionists then wanted to allow Autonomous Republics to secede from the nation-states formed by the seceding Soviet Socialist Republics.</p>
                <p>The Western Powers and their allies recruited from the Baltic States and former Warsaw Pact satellites, on the one hand, and Russia, on the other hand, indulged in equal but opposite hypocrisies. The West blessed Autonomous Republic secessionists in Russia as freedom fighters but condemned the Autonomous Republic secessionists in the Near Abroad as illegal and immoral. Russia took the opposite position for equally self-interested reasons.</p>
                <p>While the West and its allies, as previously mentioned, had an interest in strong international institutions to project power worldwide, the Russian Federation was a creation of Russian Nationalism. At first, the Russian Nationalists had wanted a strong Russia, not to secede from the USSR but to provide a power base to support lobbying for more influence over the USSR in its entirety. Even when the USSR’s government became too weak to govern the entirety of its territory after its Communist Party was banned for attempting a coup d’état against its President, the Russian Nationalists devised a looser federation, the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), to control the territory of the former USSR. Here decentralization was to Russia’s advantage since Russia could give or deny resources from itself, the greatest portion of the CIS, to the CIS governing institutions.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately for Russia’s bid to govern the former USSR in its entirety, the CIS was too decentralized for decentralization to work in Russia’s favor. The key advantage of the CIS governing institutions was that the CIS inherited the Armed Forces from the USSR and even this lasted only for the first half of 1992. The CIS members demanded the allegiance of CIS regiments and fleets peopled by their citizens. If a host nation’s CIS regiments and fleets were not peopled by the host nation’s citizens, the host nation would demand the withdrawal of these regiments and fleets. Since Russia as the provider of half the USSR’s population was the only nation that had significant sets of regiments and fleets in other CIS members, this now meant that Russia could neither project power over other CIS members through leverage over a united CIS Armed Forces nor through stationing regiments and fleets of its own in the territory of its neighbors.</p>
                <p>There were however two advantages remaining for Russia to project power through the Near Abroad. In Central Asia, the dictatorships were weak. In return for a military alliance between Russia and the Central Asian dictatorships, the Russian Armed Forces were allowed to station regiments in Central Asia. In the Eastern European nations of the Near Abroad, however, Russia’s method of acquiring garrisons was to support the rights of Autonomous Republics to secede for these nations.</p>
                <p>Aside from Azerbaijan, Baltic States and Belarus, none of these nations of the Near Abroad obtained a vertical of power. In Ukraine, the oligarchy was divided by competing nationalist factions—one that favored Ukrainian Nationalism with a Vertical of Power based in the West and one that emphasized common ties with Russia and that favored Russian legal norms as the solution to chaos. This balance of power lasted until the Euromaidan Revolution of 2013-2014.</p>
                <p>Up to then, Russia had not imposed secession as a solution for Ukrainian problems. Afterwards, it used its Black Sea Fleet stationed in Crimea to transfer the peninsula to Russia. Then it established “People’s Republics” for the secession of the Ukrainian provinces of Donetsk and Luhansk though in these cases, there were not even Autonomous Republics from the Soviet era to justify the drive for secession. The frozen conflict in Ukraine as with the frozen conflict in Georgia and Moldova prevents the integration of these nations into NATO and the EU. In Armenia and Azerbaijan, the conflict over Artsakh has been frozen by Russia balancing the two powers though with the upsurge in war over 2020, that may change.</p>
                <p>The result of all this is that the Eastern European nations of the Near Abroad beyond the Baltic coast are so unstable politically and thus economically that their GDP Per Capita is even lower than Russia’s which is still lower than the former Warsaw Pact satellites and Baltic States which themselves are still poorer than the Western powers.</p>
