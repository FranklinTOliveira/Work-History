<h3 id="droplettitle">A Paper I Wrote in 2019</h3>
<p>The Petrostate Crisis is the crisis societies that live off state petroleum revenues will face when the mass adoption of solar power and electric automobiles will devalue their assets in petroleum deposits.</p>
<p>Currently a car buyer can buy a petroleum-fueled car for $20,000 and an electric car for $40,000. It used to be that the price for the petroleum-fueled car was in the single-digit thousands while the electric car cost $100,000. Prices are converging for newly purchased vehicles. The next step is mass adoption of the electric car. Currently adoption is at 1%--with a yearly doubling, as is the case, the mathematically inclined know that doubling five times creates a 64-fold growth.</p>
<p>If in five years, in 2024, 64% of newly-purchased automobiles are electric, then within the next 1-3 years thereafter, all new purchases become electric; the next 10-20 years afterward are the lifecycle of the last petroleum-powered cars from sale to bust and rust. 23 years from 2024 is 2047.</p>
<p>From 2024-2027, cars consuming half of world petroleum output will start to consume no more. Other alternatives may be found for remaining petroleum uses. Such would be wise due to the then-ongoing Petrostate Crisis. After all, the Fracking Boom created a surplus of one million barrels per day in a 80-100 million barrels per day world market that shifted the global average price per barrel for petroleum from over $100 to under $30.</p>
<p>This Petrostate Crisis will cripple Iran, Russia and Syria. It will destroy the society of Saudi Arabia. It will also take place during a generational transfer of power. In 2024, our Baby Boomer elites will be 60-78. By 2047, they will be 83-101. The US life expectancy is 78 for men, 82 for women. Thus at the beginning mass die-offs of Baby Boomers start; at the end, only 41% of the youngest and 0.6% of the oldest of this demographic cohort will be alive. At average, 12% of the cohort will be alive at the end of this Petrostate Crisis.</p>
<p>With all the businessmen, lobbyists, think-tank professors, generals, admirals and politicians in high office whose careers depended on strengthening the US presence in the Middle East by then dead, new policymakers will be free to make new policy based on rising costs and falling gains. And so the Petrostate Crisis running over time from 5-28 years from now will be the beginning of the Great Unknown in the Middle East and the world.</p>
