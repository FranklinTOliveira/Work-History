<h1 id="reorg">Restructuring the Union</h1>
<p>In the 1860 Presidential Election, Lincoln won. In response, the Southern States seceded. After secession, some formed the Confederate States of America, while others having seceded later merely joined an already-existing CSA. The Union did not recognize the Confederacy and asserted its right to control state and local governments through its military so long as an insurrection was in place. Once the Union Army imposed a military occupation on the Confederate States of Louisiana and Tennessee, new elections were held by the Union Army to elect new Unionist state and local governments—thus, in 1864, the Unionists of both States sent Representatives and Senators to the United States Congress, as did the States of Kansas, Missouri and Virginia where rival state governments—one Unionist, one Confederate—had been in place throughout the Civil War (although the State of Virginia would be denied Congressional Representation even in the later years of the War, as most of its Unionists had branched off into the State of West Virginia).</p>
<p>In 1865, the Confederate military collapsed—some units dissolved, others surrendered—and thus the Confederacy’s confederate, state and local governments were all dissolved by the advancing Union Army as it established a military occupation regime over the defeated South. The Union Army’s military governments over the Southern states held new elections but now that the ex-Confederates resolved to work within the system, the electoral results were mixed. The new state governments and their Congressional delegations accepted the 13th Amendment (banning involuntary servitude outside of a criminal conviction) but were filled with ex-Confederates opposed to the 14th Amendment (extending the rights of citizenship to all born on American soil) and the 15th Amendment (making voting rights part of the rights granted to all citizens).</p>
<p>In reaction, the Radical Republicans in Congress rejected the Southern delegations to Congress, declaring that since secession equaled suicide as “republican states”, the land in question now reverted to the direct jurisdiction of the federal government. Accordingly, the occupation garrisons of the Union Army would rule the Southern states through military governments in each of the five districts carved out of the former Confederacy. The mission of these district military governments and their occupation soldiers was “Reconstruction”—rebuilding the Southern states into loyal members of the Union. In keeping with Reconstruction, ex-Confederates were disenfranchised while former slaves received the vote, joining scalawags (Southern whites sympathizing with the Union) and carpetbaggers (Northern whites moving to the South, often profiting personally from administrative positions in Reconstruction governments) in forming a new electorate.</p>
<h2>Reconstruction Timeline</h2>
<ul><li>1865: Union Army occupies the Confederacy, dissolving Confederate, state and local governments. The Union Army finds that it does not have enough men to directly administer the South at the federal, state and local levels, especially in light of postwar demobilization. In addition to carpetbaggers and scalawags, the Union move to integrate freedmen and ex-Confederates into the state and local governments as both officials and voters. Indeed the Southern state elections of 1865 returned ex-Confederates for their state Congressional delegations which were in turn rejected by Congress.</li><br/>
<li>1866: State elections in the North added Radical Republicans to its Congressional delegations. In light of the rejection of the Southern Congressional delegations, the Congress now elaborated on their thoughts on the matter. By seceding from the Union, the former Confederate States, declared the Union Congress, had committed suicide as “republican states” and their land therefore was under the direct jurisdiction of the federal government. To assert its direct authority, the Union Congress established five military districts over the former Confederate States with the commanding officers of the military districts tasked with deploying their garrisons to enforce Reconstruction of the state and local governments.</li><br/>
<li>1867-1877: Reconstruction was considered the primary goal in governing the South—even when its states were allowed to send
    delegations to Congress, the Union Army would assert its right to control state and local politics</li><br/>
<ul><li>1867-1870: For the first few years of 1867 onward, Southern states were subject to five military districts and were denied representation in Congress. Ex-Confederates were disenfranchised and Northerners, white Southern Unionists and black freedmen elected Republicans to state offices.</li><br/>
<li>1870: The Southern states were now allowed representation in Congress but the Union Army still interfered in their politics to ensure that Unionists (represented by the Republican Party) stayed on top rather than ex-Confederates (represented by Conservative and Democratic Parties).</li></ul></ul>
